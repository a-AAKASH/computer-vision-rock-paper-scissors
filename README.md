# Computer Vision RPS
This is the classic Rock Paper Scissors game but implemented in the computer. So you play against it. The only thing you need is your camera along with your Rock, Paper and Scissors.

The aim of the project is to implement a simple computer vision model created from Teachable Machine and then implementing the logic in python. 

*manual_rps.py* on the repo is a manual Rock, Paper and Scissors game. It was created to create the initial logic in the code which could be used further down the game itself.
